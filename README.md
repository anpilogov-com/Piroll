# Piroll
My first website lately. I was trying to adapt this website as much as possible from a layout in Adobe Photoshop that was made for versioning computers. I hope you enjoy the result of the adaptation for mobile devices.

# Lighthouse
Based on Google Lighthouse research the website is reasonably well optimized in several ways.

# Technological
Next, the technologies used in the project.

## HTML5
The project used the latest version 5 hypertext markup standard for 2021.

A semantic page layout was applied with adaptation for voiceover.

Synthetic tests were performed using Lighthouse and UX tests were performed  typical human.

## CSS3
A flexible-adaptive layout for different screen resolutions was implemented.
Thanks to the third standard for cascading styles, it was possible to use modern solutions for cascading.

Please note: IE may display some elements of the site incorrectly, since the page has not been adapted with polyphony expressions.

## JS
Standard JS features were used without exotic refinements.
